# LearnDash Retake Quiz
Learndash Retake Quiz is a LearnDash addon which is supposed to override the deafult behavior of how the retake quiz feature is implemented in LearnDash. By default, when someone retakes the course they have to take all the questions again. However, using this addon will override this behavior, by showing only the questions which weren't answered correctly by the user. which means the user will only have to answer those questions again which were not answered correctly.  If the user answers all answers correct and clicks retake quiz then they will see all the questions this time, this is the default behavior of LearnDash and is not altered by this addon
